We're creating a new project in IntelliJ and must have something wrong because when we right click on a directory, select New and then get the context menu, Java based options are not shown. Currently get things like File, some HTML options, XML options.
The directory or one of the parent directories must be marked as Source Root (In this case, it appears in blue).
If you open your module settings (F4) you can nominate which paths contain 'source'. Intellij will then mark these directories in blue and allow you to add classes etc.
This can also happen if your package name is invalid.
For example, if your "package" is com.my-company (which is not a valid Java package name due to the dash), IntelliJ will prevent you from creating a Java Class in that package.
